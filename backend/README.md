# Basic outline

This is the backend server for mini-amazon.
I'm using mysql for db and flask for web app.
So you should have mysql installed on your machine to run this app.
Other than that, I'm using sqlalchemy as a connector(client) between mysql and flask.
All the dependencies are in the requirements.txt so please take a look

# Update(add below for all the team)

2020/10/07 - I've(Louis) created backbone of the backend so feel free to jump into whichever part you want to implement
